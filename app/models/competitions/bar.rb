module Competitions
  # Best All-around Rider Competition. Assigns points for each top-15 placing in major Disciplines: road, track, etc.
  # Calculates a BAR for each Discipline, and an Overall BAR that combines all the discipline BARs.
  # Also calculates a team BAR.
  # Recalculating the BAR at years-end can take nearly 30 minutes even on a fast server. Recalculation must be manually triggered.
  # This class implements a number of OBRA-specific rules and should be generalized and simplified.
  # The BAR categories and disciplines are all configured in the database. Race categories need to have a bar_category_id to
  # show up in the BAR; disciplines must exist in the disciplines table and discipline_bar_categories.
