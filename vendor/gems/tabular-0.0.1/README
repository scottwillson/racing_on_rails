Tabular is a Ruby library for reading, writing, and manipulating CSV, tab-delimited and Excel data.

I extracted it from production code. Still extracting it, actually. I need to read structured data and manipulate it via a common interface before persisting it with ActiveRecord.


Dependencies
------------
For tab-delimited data: Ruby standard lib
For CSV: FasterCSV
For Excel: Spreadsheet gem


Examples
--------
>> table = Table.read("test/fixtures/sample.csv")
>> table.rows.size
=> 4

Access Table Rows by index:
>> table[0]

And Row cells as a Hash:
>> table[0][:last_name]
=> "Willson"


Usage
-----
Table.read assumes that .txt files are tab-delimited, .csv files are comma-delimited, and .xls files are Excel. It assumes that the first row is the header row, and normalizes the header to lower-case with underscores. E.g., "Last Name" becomes "last_name".

Table.new accepts an Array of Arrays.

Table.new also accepts an options hash. Currently, :columns is the only option. Examples:
:city_state => :location -- Maps :city_state column to :location. A column with a "City State" header would be accessed as row[:location]
:flyer_approved  => { :column_type => :boolean } -- Coerce :flyer_approved column cells to booleans.


Tests
-----
There's basic test coverage. More comprehensive test coverage needs to be extracted from original projects. Run 'rake test'.
